# Playwright MCP Testing Rules

## Required Screen Width Testing
When using the Playwright MCP server to test UI components or pages, **ALWAYS** test across these three screen widths to ensure responsive design compatibility:

1. **Mobile**: 393px width (iPhone 14 Pro size)
2. **Tablet**: 768px width (iPad portrait)  
3. **Desktop**: 1512px width (large desktop)

## Testing Workflow
Follow this sequence when testing with Playwright MCP:

### 1. Navigate to Page
```javascript
// Navigate to the target page first
await mcp_playwright_browser_navigate({ url: "your-url-here" })
```

### 2. Test Each Screen Width
For each of the required widths, perform this sequence:

```javascript
// Resize browser to target width
await mcp_playwright_browser_resize({ width: 393, height: 852 })  // Mobile
await mcp_playwright_browser_resize({ width: 768, height: 1024 }) // Tablet  
await mcp_playwright_browser_resize({ width: 1512, height: 982 }) // Desktop

// Take screenshot for visual verification (always save in .playwright-mcp folder)
await mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot({ 
  filename: ".playwright-mcp/test-mobile-393px.png",
  fullPage: true 
})

// Capture accessibility snapshot for interaction testing
await mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot()
```

### 3. Recommended Heights
Use these heights with the corresponding widths:
- **393px width**: 852px height (mobile viewport)
- **768px width**: 1024px height (tablet viewport)
- **1512px width**: 982px height (desktop viewport)

## Testing Checklist
For each screen width, verify:
- [ ] Navigation elements are properly positioned and accessible
- [ ] Content is readable and properly formatted
- [ ] Interactive elements (buttons, forms) are appropriately sized
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling occurs unexpectedly
- [ ] Images and media scale appropriately
- [ ] Typography remains legible across all sizes

## Material-UI Responsive Considerations
Since this project uses Material-UI, pay special attention to:
- Grid breakpoints behavior (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- AppBar responsive behavior
- Drawer/navigation responsive patterns
- Typography scaling across viewports
- Button and form element sizing

## Example Complete Test Sequence
```javascript
// 1. Navigate to page
await mcp_playwright_browser_navigate({ url: "http://localhost:3000" })

// 2. Test Mobile (393px)
await mcp_playwright_browser_resize({ width: 393, height: 852 })
await mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot({ filename: ".playwright-mcp/mobile-393.png", fullPage: true })
await mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot()

// 3. Test Tablet (768px) 
await mcp_playwright_browser_resize({ width: 768, height: 1024 })
await mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot({ filename: ".playwright-mcp/tablet-768.png", fullPage: true })
await mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot()

// 4. Test Desktop (1512px)
await mcp_playwright_browser_resize({ width: 1512, height: 982 })
await mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot({ filename: ".playwright-mcp/desktop-1512.png", fullPage: true })
await mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot()
```

## Screenshot Storage Requirements
- **ALWAYS save screenshots in the `.playwright-mcp/` folder** - this folder is gitignored
- Use descriptive filenames that include screen width (e.g., `mobile-393.png`, `tablet-768.png`, `desktop-1512.png`)
- The `.playwright-mcp/` folder is automatically created by Playwright MCP and should not be committed to git

## Critical Requirements
- **NEVER skip any of the three screen widths** - all are mandatory for complete testing
- **ALWAYS take both screenshots and snapshots** for comprehensive documentation
- **ALWAYS save screenshots in `.playwright-mcp/` folder** - never save to root or other directories
- **Test interactive elements** at each screen size to ensure usability
- **Document any responsive issues** found during testing across different viewports
