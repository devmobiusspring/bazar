# Figma MCP Tool Usage Rules

## Component Filtering
When using the Figma MCP tool to generate UI code, **ALWAYS ignore** the following components as they are only for Figma mock purposes:

- **Status Bar/iPhone** - This is a mock component showing device status
- **URL Bar/iPhone** - This is a mock component showing browser navigation

## Best Practices
1. Focus on actual UI components that represent real functionality
2. Skip mock/placeholder components that don't contribute to the actual interface
3. Look for components with meaningful names that represent real UI elements
4. When in doubt, examine the component hierarchy to identify mock vs. real components

## Usage
- Use `mcp_Figma_get_code` to generate code for selected components
- Use `mcp_Figma_get_image` to generate images for reference
- Use `mcp_Figma_get_variable_defs` to extract design tokens
- Always filter out mock components before generating code
